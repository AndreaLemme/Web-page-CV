        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Ambitious, persistent, and driven are
          3 words that summarise who I am. I
          have recently completed my
          honours studies for Information
          Systems at the University of Cape
          Town ,where I have taken a particular
          liking to careers oriented in the
          Cybersecurity, Business analysis, and
          Web Development sectors. My
          Italian and South African dual
          citizenship allows me to work in the
          European Union and South Africa
          without a visa. In my free time I enjoy
          any outdoor related activities due to
          my great sense of adventure and
          curiosity
